# GOES_EUV
GOES EUV Products for IT Modeling

This code processes solar EUV data from several sources includingâ€¦
CU LASP TIMED-SEE
CU LASP SDO-EVE
NOAA NCEI GOES-EUVS/XRS
It processes the data and creates combined data files.   
The ultimate goal is to create parameterized solar EUV drivers for ionosphere and thermospheric modeling.  In particular the EUV bands developed by Solomon, S. C., and L. Qian (2005), Solar extreme-ultraviolet irradiance for general circulation models, J. Geophys. Res., 110, A10306, doi:10.1029/2005JA011160 (Stan Bands) and the EUV bands developed by Richards, P. G., J. A. Fennelly, and D. G. Torr (1994), EUVAC: A solar EUV flux model for aeronomic calculations, J. Geophys. Res., 99, 8981, doi:10.1029/94JA00518.(EUVAC).
